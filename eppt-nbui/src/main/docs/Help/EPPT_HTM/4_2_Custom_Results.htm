    <h2>4.2. Custom Results</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;">The Custom Results Dashboard allows the user to filter and retrieve variables directly from the DV or SV file, including variables that cannot be selected through Quick Results or Map View. The filtered variables can be displayed in the same format as those brought up from Quick Results (i.e. Exceedance Plots, tables). This feature combines the broad range of post-processing features from Quick Results with the ability to bring up and analyze any variable in the DSS files. The user can view the data for these variables directly, or they may elect to create derived time-series (DTS) from them. DTS are created by combining two or more time-series with basic mathematical operators and may be custom-tailored to fit the needs of a specific project or investigation. These DTS can be saved and accessed at a later session.</span></p>
