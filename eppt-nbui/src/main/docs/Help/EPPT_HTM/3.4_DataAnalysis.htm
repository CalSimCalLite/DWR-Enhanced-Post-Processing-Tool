  <h2>3.4. Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>The Data Analysis window (Figure 3-4) allows the user to produce a standardized comparison or corroboration report comparing two CalLite scenarios, two CalSim 2 scenarios, two CalSim 3 scenarios or between scenarios of any two of the previously mentioned models.</p>
  <p>The report shows storage in major reservoirs, flows at key river segments, CVP and SWP deliveries, and other scenario outputs.</p>
  <p>In order to generate the report, use the Select File buttons to select a report template file (.inp file), two DSS output files, and a report output file name. Next, enter names for each of the two studies to be compared (defaults are set to CalLite 1 and CalLite 2), and hit the Generate Report button. Optional information such as notes, assumptions, and modeler name can also be added to the report.</p>

  <p><strong><span class="hcp1">CalSim 2-CalSim 2 comparison: </span></strong></p>
  <p>The default report template file (calsim_calsim_comparison.inp) will compare two CalSim 2 scenarios.  <span class="hcp1"></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="hcp2"><strong><span class="hcp1">CalLite-CalLite comparison: </span></strong></p>
  <p>Click “Select File …” in the “Report Template File” row and select “callite_scenario_comparison.inp”.. <span class="hcp1"></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong><span class="hcp1"><a>CalSim 3-CalSim 3 comparison: </a></span></strong></p>
  <p>Click “Select File …” in the “Report Template File” row and select “calSim3_calSim3_comparison.inp”. <span class="hcp1"></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="hcp2"><strong><span class="hcp1">CalSim 2-CalLite corroboration: </span></strong></p>
  <p>The report tool can also be used to compare CalLite results to CalSim results. To do this, the DSS Result File #1 must be set to the output DSS from a CalSim simulation, the DSS Result File #2 must be set to the output DSS from a CalLite simulation and the report template file must be set to “calsim_callite_corroboration.inp.”   <span class="hcp1"></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="hcp2"><strong><span class="hcp1">CalSim 3-CalLite corroboration: </span></strong></p>
  <p>To compare CalSim 3 results to CalLite results, the DSS Result File #1 must be set to the output DSS from a CalSim 3 simulation, the DSS Result File #2 must be set to the output DSS from a CalLite simulation and the report template file must be set to “calsim3_callite_corroboration.inp.”<span class="hcp1"></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="hcp2"><strong><span class="hcp1">CalSim 3-CalSim 2 corroboration: </span></strong></p>
  <p>To compare CalSim 3 results to CalSim2 results, the DSS Result File #1 must be set to the output DSS from a CalSim 3 simulation, the DSS Result File #2 must be set to the output DSS from a CalSim2 simulation and the report template file must be set to “calsim3_calsim_corroboration.inp.”</p>
  <p class="hcp2"> </p>
