  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
  <p>The Enhanced Post Processing Tool (EPPT) Help Document facilitates easy use of the EPPT graphical user interface (GUI) by describing all windows, panels, and options available on the GUI. For information on aspects of the model other than the GUI, see the <a>EPPT Appendices</a>, distributed as a separate PDF.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>1.1.  The Enhanced Post Processing Tool</h2>
  <p>EPPT provides enhanced visualization results support for CalLite, CalSim 2, and CalSim 3 models. The application generates data from a post processing WRESL script for use in a QA/QC Report. This smart report generates detailed graphs and tables based on well-defined threshold values as well as reviewing model output to flag and report any concerning study behavior.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>1.2.  Installation</h2>
  <p>EPPT is currently provided as an executable file. Installation consists of running the executable file that extracts the EPPT contents in the same folder the executable is located. After running the executable file, users can start the EPPT GUI by double-clicking on the file “<a>EPPT.exe</a>” in the root directory located at dwr_eppt (Figure 1-1).</p>
