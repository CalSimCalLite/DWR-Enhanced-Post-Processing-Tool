  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
  <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;">The EPPT User&#39;s Guide facilitates easy use of the EPPT GUI by describing all screens, dashboards, panels, and options available on the GUI. For information on aspects of the model other than the graphical user interface (GUI), see the EPPT Reference Manual, distributed as a separate PDF.</span></p>
  <h2>1.1 The Enhanced Post Processing Tool</h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;">The purpose of the Enhanced Post Processing Tool (EPPT) is to provide enhanced visualization support for CalLite, CalSim2, and CalSim3 models. The application generates data from a post-processing WRESL script for use in a QA/QC Report. This smart report generates detailed graphs and tables based on well-defined threshold values as well as reviewing model output to flag and report any concerning study behavior.</span></p>
  <h2>1.2. Installation</h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;">EPPT is currently delivered in a zip installer file or executable. The installation consists of extracting all files in the archive (.zip) to a file system location on a Windows 10 computer or running the EPPT Application Installer Wizard. After installation, a shortcut to EPPT is generated on the desktop. Users can start EPPT GUI by double-clicking on the file “dwr_eppt64.exe” in the root directory of the extracted version located at dwr_eppt -&gt; bin (see<strong> Figure 1-1</strong> below) or clicking on the EPPT Application icon on the desktop. For 32-bit machines, a user can click on “dwr_eppt.exe.”</span></p>
