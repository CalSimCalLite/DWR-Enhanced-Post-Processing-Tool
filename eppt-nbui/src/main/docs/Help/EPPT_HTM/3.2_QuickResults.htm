  <h2>3.2. Quick Results</h2>
  <p>Under the Quick Results window (Figure 3-2), graphs and tables can be generated for numerous CalLite, CalSim 2, and CalSim 3 outputs, either for one scenario or for comparing multiple scenarios based on the Project Configuration settings. The different panels on this window are as follows:</p>
  <p>Report List: This panel of the window can be used to create <a>reports</a> based on user selections. Clicking the Add to List button, following the selection of a variable(s), will add the variable(s) to the list. The report will then include all variables that have been selected. In addition, the report will reflect user options within the Scenario and Display areas of the dashboard. Reports on the list can then be displayed (individually or all at once) and saved for later use. Lists can also be saved and reloaded using the Save List and Load List buttons, respectively.</p>
  <p>Output selection:  Control-clicking any of the variable names in the Report List section will display graphs and tables for that specific variable.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Storage + Flows – standard output variables for flow, storage, and salinity</li>
    <li>San Joaquin R. – San Joaquin River terms for storage, flow, deliveries, and salinity</li>
    <li>Shortages/Flow Obj. – shortages in accretion/depletion (AD) terms for the North of Delta area, and comparisons of Delta outflow and Sacramento/San Joaquin River flows to the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) Delta Flow Criteria</li>
    <li>Water Mgt. Actions – <a>Los Vaqueros terms</a></li>
    <li>Delivery Shortages – SWP and CVP South of Delta delivery shortage terms</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When graphs are displayed it is possible to zoom in by clicking and dragging the cursor to create a box. Once zoomed in, the user can pan by holding down the left button and the Control key, and then moving the mouse. Right clicking in the graph area will bring up a menu that allows the user to edit properties of the graph; copy, save, and print the graph; zoom in, zoom out, and reset the plot to its original zoom; and copy the data used to create the graph into the clipboard for use in another application. <a>In addition to the primary time-series, certain graphs also display secondary time-series (described in the legend) and other types of plots such as exceedance plots.</a> </p>
