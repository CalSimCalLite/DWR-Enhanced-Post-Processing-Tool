    <h2>4.1. Quick Results</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;">Under the Quick Results dashboard, graphs and tables can be generated for numerous CalLite, CalSim II, and CalSim 3 outputs, either for one scenario or for comparing multiple scenarios. The different sections on this dashboard are as follows:</span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;"><strong><span class="hcp1">Report List.</span></strong> This section of the dashboard can be used to create reports based on user selections. Clicking the <span class="hcp3">Add To List</span> button, following the selection of a variable(s), will add the variable(s) to the list. The report will then include all variables that have been selected. In addition, the report will reflect the user options within the Scenario and Display areas of the dashboard. Reports on the list can then be displayed (individually or all at once) and saved for later use. Lists can also be saved and reloaded using the <span class="hcp3">Save List</span> and Load List buttons, respectively.</span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;"><strong><span class="hcp1">Output selection.</span></strong> Double-clicking any of the variable names in the Report List section will display graphs and tables for that specific variable.</span></p>
    <ul class="Disc" data-start="1.1">
      <li><em><span class="hcp3">Storage + Flows</span></em> – standard output variables for flow, storage, and salinity</li>
      <li><em><span class="hcp3">San Joaquin R.</span></em> – San Joaquin River terms for storage, flow, deliveries, and salinity</li>
      <li><em><span class="hcp3">Shortages/Flow Obj.</span></em> – shortages in accretion/depletion (AD) terms for the North of Delta area, and comparisons of Delta outflow and Sacramento/San Joaquin River flows to the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) Delta Flow Criteria</li>
      <li><em><span class="hcp3">Water Mgt. Actions</span> </em>– Los Vaqueros terms</li>
      <li><em><span class="hcp3">Delivery Shortages</span> </em>– SWP and CVP South of Delta delivery shortage terms</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;">When graphs are displayed it is possible to zoom in by clicking and dragging the cursor to the lower right to create a box. Once zoomed in, the user can pan by holding down the left button and the Control key, and then moving the mouse. Right-clicking in the graph area will bring up a menu that allows the user to edit properties of the graph; copy, save, and print the graph; zoom in, zoom out, and reset the plot to its original zoom; and copy the data used to create the graph into the clipboard for use in another application. In addition to the primary time-series, certain graphs also display secondary time-series (described in the legend).</span></p>
