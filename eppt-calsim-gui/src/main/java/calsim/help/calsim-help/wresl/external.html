<P>External functions may be incorporated into the model through the use of an external function declaration.
    Declarations must occur before the function is used in a value statement. LF90 and C++ functions are permitted. For
    LF90, the code must be compiled and the object code located in the external directory. For C++, the code must be
    compiled into a dynamic-link-library and a LF90 function written to import the DLL. These files must then be placed
    in the external directory together with the LIB file. The names of the object and LIB files must be the same as the
    function name used in the WRESL statement. External functions must be specified as the LF90 or dll variety. LF90 is
    the default type.</P>
