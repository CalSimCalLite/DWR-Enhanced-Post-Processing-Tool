<P>Sequence statements define the order and optional condition in which to simulate a study consisting of multiple
    models. For example, it may be desirable to the modeler to operate a portion of the water resource system
    independent of the remaining system. In this case, the system may be divided into two models: the first including
    the portion to be operated independently and the second including the remaining part of the system. The first model
    could then be given the simulation order 1 and the second simulation order 2. The results of simulating the first
    model could then be used in the modeling of the second model. Each model must be given a unique simulation
    order.</P>
