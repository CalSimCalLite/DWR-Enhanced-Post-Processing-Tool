<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the <B>File</B> menu followed by "<B>Open Base</B>" and then "<B>Dvar File</B>" ( <B>File|OpenBase|Dvar
    File</B>, I will be using this convention from now on). This should open a filechooser dialog box. Goto the testdata
    directory under the calsim distribution and select a dvar file ( usually ending in dv.dss ). Let us select
    sim514dv.dss for now.&nbsp; If selected the named file should display in the status panel. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To load the svar file click <B>File|Open Base|Svar File</B>. This should open a file chooser from
    which you should select sim514sv.dss file. This completes loading a model run and now we are ready for some
    analysis. <BR>
