<P>"Tables" present the output in simple columnar form, with monthly data for one variable in each column after the
    first. This method is particularly useful for viewing output in the comparison mode when more than two studies need
    to be compared. Tables are also useful for transferring data to a spreadsheet program for further data
    analysis. </P>
