<P>Whether filtered or not, find the variable(s) (B-part) for the data to be viewed in the table on the General tab.
    Note: the variables are arranged alphabetically by B-part, not by magnitude of the number in the B-part. Thus A29
    will be listed before A3.</P>
<P>If a variable is not there and the data was filtered, check to make sure the correct variable type (DVAR or SVAR) is
    selected. If it is, the text used for filtering the data was typed incorrectly (or the variable does not exist in
    the dss file). Correct the filter text and click the filter button again. Once the variables are found, select the
    lines (variables) for which output is to be displayed, then click the <B>Retrieve</B> button to display the data in
    the View format selected</P>
