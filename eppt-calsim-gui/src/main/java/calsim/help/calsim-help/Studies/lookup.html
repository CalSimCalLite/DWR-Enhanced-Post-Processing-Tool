    <P>Relational data is stored in text files located in the &quot;study\run\lookup&quot; directory. These files must
        have extension <I>.table.</I> Up to five comment lines (use &quot;!&quot;) may be added to the top of the file.
        The first non-comment line must contain the name of the table as specified in WRESL <I>select from</I>
        statements and must also match the name of the file (less the extension <I>.table</I>). The line following the
        name of the table contains the field names to be searched (i.e. year_type, month, etc). Below this line is the
        data associated with each field and must only contain numeric values. Improvements to the lookup table will be
        performed in future versions.</P>
