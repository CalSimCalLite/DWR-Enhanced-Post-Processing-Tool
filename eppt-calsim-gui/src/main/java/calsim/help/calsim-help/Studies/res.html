    <P>Each reservoir node can be divided up to ten zones representing operational volumes. In general there are five
        zones: dead pool, lower conservation pool, intermediate conservation pool, upper conservation pool, and flood
        control pool. The upper levels of each zone are entered into the table as well as the estimated linear
        evaporation coefficient and the outlet arc. All units are assumed to be in thousand acre-feet (TAF).</P>
