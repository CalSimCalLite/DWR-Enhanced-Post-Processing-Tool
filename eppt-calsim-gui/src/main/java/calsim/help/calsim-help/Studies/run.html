    <P>Switching to the Study | Run tab, press the "Check" button to check the syntax of the all WRESL files included in
        a study. Results of the syntax check will be displayed on this panel. The message "Parsing Complete" will be
        displayed if the syntax was successful parsed.</P>

    <P> Press the "Run" button to run a study. The run consists of the parsing of WRESL statements, the compilation of
        WRESL statements into Fortran code, and the execution of the compiled model (Parsing and compilation is
        performed only if changes have been made to the wresl files). The Status bar will indicate when these steps are
        taking place. Once the execution step has begun a small message window will display the time period being
        simulated and other basic information. Once the execution is completed and is successful, a "Normal
        Completion". </P>
